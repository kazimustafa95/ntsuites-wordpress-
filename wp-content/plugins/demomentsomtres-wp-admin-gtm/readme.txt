== Description ==

DeMomentSomTres Google Tag Manager for WP-Admin allows to extend DuracellTomi's Google Tag Manager into WP administration.

= History & Raison d’être =

We rebuilt [Masies del Penedès](http://www.masiesdelpenedes.com Cottages in Penedès, the land of wine and cava) website and provide users some administration functionality. As we needed to track user interaction with WordPress'Backoffice. The easiest and more functional way we found was to extend DuracellTomi to this area. 

== Installation ==

This tools plugin can be installed as any other WordPress plugin. 

It obviously requires [DuracellTomi's Google Tag Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duracelltomi-google-tag-manager/ Google Tag Manager for WordPress).

No configuration required.
